# Navigation in Daedalus User Interface

Daedalus, the wallet of Cardano SL, offers a multitude of functions that are easy and intuitive to use. The current set of features consists of the following options:

 + Checking your balance
 + Making transactions
 + Creating custom wallets tailored for your needs
 + Setting up identity

More features are coming soon, so stay tuned for changes to this documentation.

## Layout

The general layout of the UI gives room for three sections (left, middle and right), excluding the header, footer and the margins used for composition. In the document, the left side refers to _the menu_, the middle one refers to _main contents_ of page in question, and the right one holds _information and extra options_.

## Wallet
![Daedalus wallet](/img/daedalus/wallet.jpg)

This section is denoted with an icon of a wallet and highlighted upon hovering. Each sub-menu contains information about Ada balance corresponding to each wallet and an option to _send_ and _receive_ money (highlighted upon hovering). Each wallet shows transaction history in chronological order.

### Sending Money

To send money you click the “Send Money” button and fill in the following fields:

 1. Receiver (Ada address)
 2. Amount (in Ada tokens)
 3. Description (optional)

Then press the "Send" button.

### Receiving Money

If you want to receive money from someone and want to give them your address, click the “Receive Money” button. Your address will be displayed in the midsection, as well as its QR encoding.

We are working on generating requests for specific amounts of Ada. We will provide a field to do this below (now it is inactive).

Upon clicking "sending" or "receiving" the menu will stay the same, showing wallet balance.

Upon clicking the hamburger button a sub-menu is expanded, listing your wallets and providing you with an option to add a new wallet.

## Settings
![Daedalus identity](/img/daedalus/identity.jpg)

This section is denoted with a double toggle icon on the far left side of the page.
Upon clicking it, a profile editing page with the following fields is opened:

 1. Name
 2. E-mail
 3. Profile picture upload
 4. Phone number
 5. Password
 6. Language

You can upload a profile picture by dragging and dropping a file or clicking Upload.

The Password field shows when the password was last updated.

On the right, more groups of settings can be seen (aside from the Profile which was already discussed before):

 1. Security
 2. Identity and Verification
 3. Display
 4. Privacy
 5. Terms of Use

## Staking

Staking information, Delegation and Instant Buy options are something we're considering to add in the nearest future. For now, the process of staking is carried out automatically in the background.
