# Joining Network

Cardano SL being a decentralized system, we produced it as an open
network, meaning that anyone can join the network and start
participating in the protocol. To provide peer discovery we're using
a hardened Kademlia DHT protocol. To join the network, a node has to know
at least one other node. We call this node the bootstrap node. Even
though the pool of bootstrap nodes is hardcoded, you can use any other
stable node for bootstrap.
