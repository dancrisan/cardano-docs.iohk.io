## Wallet API

Currently, the wallet's API provides a series of methods to work
with wallets. The `servant` Haskell library that provides a modular
approach to API-building was used. This library uses combinators to both build atomic HTTP actions and to glue these atomic methods together to form larger and more
complete APIs.

If the event requests fail, there is a `WalletError` type, which
is simply a wrapper over `Text` to show what happened.

Please note that:

* The code `Post '[JSON]` and `Get '[JSON]` indicates that the type of the contents in the message will be `[JSON]`.
* `ReqBody '[JSON] t` extracts the request body `[JSON]` as a value of type `t`.

Currently, the wallet's API supports the following operations (see Comments below):

|---
| API endpoint | Uses | Action | Description
|:-|:-|:-|:-
| `get_wallet` | `address :: CAddress` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Fetch the wallet related to a given address address, if it exists.
| `get-wallets` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError [CWallet])` | Fetch all wallets to which the system has access to.
| `send` | `from, to :: CAddress;`<br/> `amount :: Coin` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CTx)` | Send coins in the default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, without any transaction message or description. `[1]`
| `txhistory` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/> `limit :: Word` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions where the address took part in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `search-txhistory` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `search :: Text;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/> `limit :: Word` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions whose title has `search` as an infix, in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `update-transaction` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `transaction :: CTxId;`<br/> `ReqBody '[JSON] CTxMeta` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Add the transaction which has the given ID to the wallet's transaction history, if such a transaction exists.
| `new-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Create a new wallet.
| `restore-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Recover the wallet associated to the given backup information `[3]`, if it exists.
| `update-wallet` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletMeta` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Given an address and wallet meta-information, update the address' wallet.
| `delete_wallet` | `address :: CAddress` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Delete the wallet associated to an address.
| `valid-address` | `currency :: CCurrency;`<br/> `address :: Text` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Bool)` | Reply with `True` if the address is valid, and `False` otherwise. `[4]`
| `get-profile` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` | Fetch the client's current user profile - the datatype `CProfile`. `[5]`
| `update-profile` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CProfile` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` | Update the user's profile, returning the new one in the process.
| `redeem-ada` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletRedeem` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Redeem ADA from a token `[6]`, create and return a wallet with the redeemded ADA.
| `next-update` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CUpdateInfo)` | Fetch information related to the next update.
| `apply-update` | Nothing | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Apply the system's most recent update.
| `slot-duration` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Word)` | Fetch the value of current slot duration.
| `system-version` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError SoftwareVersion)` | Fetch the system's version.
|---

Comments:

* `[1]`: Neither of these methods presently support many-to-many transactions.
* `[2]`: The transactions are in ascending order of age, i.e. newer transactions come first.
* `[3]`: A wallet's backup phrase and a wallet's meta-information (`CWalletMeta`).
* `[4]`: Presently, any currency other than `ADA` results in a `False`.
* `[5]`: `CProfile` has several fields, among them: the user's name, their email, their phone number, the hash of their password, the `POSIX`-formatted time at which the account was created, their location, and the account's picture.
* `[6]`: An `ADA` redemption token is represented by the datatype `CWalletRedeem`, which has the address where the `ADA` intended to be redeemed will go to, and a redemption seed.
