# What is Daedalus

In developing Cardano SL, the need arose for a UI from which users could access
their funds, send and receive transactions, and perform other tasks related to
managing a personal cryptocurrency wallet. The Daedalus wallet is the Cardano's
solution to these necessities.

Currently, it allows a user to use their ADA in the aforementioned actions, and
support for other currencies is planned for the near future, as is the exchange
between different currencies, both digital and not.

## Building `daedalus-client-api`

To run `daedalus-client-api` locally you have to start the `wallet-api` of [`cardano-sl`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/) as follows. Make sure that you are in the root folder of `cardano-sl`.

~~~bash
# build app
stack build
# remove old PureScript types if they exist
rm -rf daedalus/src/Generated
# generate PureScript types
stack exec -- cardano-wallet-hs2purs
~~~

This should create PureScript modules with datatypes bridged from Haskell. You should have similar structure like:

~~~bash
$ tree daedalus/src/Generated/
daedalus/src/Generated/
└── Pos
	├── Types
	│   └── Core.purs
	├── Util
	│   └── BackupPhrase.purs
	└── Wallet
		└── Web
			├── ClientTypes.purs
			└── Error.purs
~~~

## Running and testing `daedalus-client-api`

In order to see `daedalus-client-api` in action, first run a local Cardano network:

~~~bash
# run tmux in another window
tmux
# launch nodes
export WALLET_TEST=1; ./scripts/launch.sh
~~~

By default, this should launch Cardano network consisting of 3 nodes talking to each other. `WALLET_TEST=1` tells the launcher script to run `wallet-api` with one node. This one node running `wallet-api` will behave the same as Daedalus wallet that is run in production. If you experience any issues, remove the following content first and build `wallet-api` again as described above.

~~~
rm -rf ./run/*
rm -rf wallet-db
rm node-*.*.key
~~~

With a running `wallet-api` you can run `daedalus-client-api` locally as follows.
Please note that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required to build `daedalus-client-api`.

~~~bash
cd daedalus
npm install
npm run build:prod
~~~

Now we can try using the client API with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/):

~~~bash
$ node
> var api = require('../output/Daedalus.ClientApi')
undefined
> api
{ applyUpdate: [Function],
  blockchainSlotDuration: [Function],
  deleteWallet: [Function],
  generateMnemonic: [Function: generateMnemonic],
  getHistory: [Function],
  getProfile: [Function],
  getWallet: [Function],
  getWallets: [Function],
  importKey: [Function],
  isValidAddress: [Function],
  isValidMnemonic: [Function],
  newWallet: [Function],
  nextUpdate: [Function],
  notify: [Function],
  redeemADA: [Function],
  restoreWallet: [Function],
  restoreWalletIgnoreChecksum: [Function],
  searchHistory: [Function],
  send: [Function],
  sendExtended: [Function],
  syncProgress: [Function],
  systemVersion: [Function],
  testReset: [Function],
  updateProfile: [Function],
  updateTransaction: [Function],
  updateWallet: [Function] }
~~~

This will load and show all functions that can be run from from this library to interact with the wallet. For example, to fetch all available wallets we can do:

~~~bash
> api.getWallets().then(console.log).catch(console.log)
Promise { <pending> }
> [ { cwMeta:
	 { cwType: 'CWTPersonal',
	   cwName: 'Personal Wallet',
	   cwCurrency: 'ADA' },
	cwAmount: { getCoin: 33333 },
	cwAddress: '1gLFDJAKutVJCYioMANx4gthHru5K12Tk9YpEmXKQfggKZu' } ]
~~~

Note: `daedalus-client-api` is not optimized/compressed. This is will be a job for Daedalus.


## Wallet Frontend API

Currently, the wallet's API provides a series of methods to work with wallets. The `servant` Haskell library that provides a modular approach to API-building is used. This library uses combinators to both build atomic HTTP actions and to glue these atomic methods together to form larger and more complete APIs.

If the event requests fail, there is a `WalletError` type, which is just a wrapper over `Text` to show what has happened.

Please note that:

* The code `Post '[JSON]` and `Get '[JSON]` indicates that the type of the contents in the message will be `[JSON]`.
* `ReqBody '[JSON] t` extracts the request body `[JSON]` as a value of type `t`.

Currently, the wallet's API supports the following operations (see Comments below):

| API | Endpoint | Parameter | Optional parameters | Description |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| GET | /api/addresses |  |  | Returns all addresses contained in wallet.<br/>  |
| GET | /api/addresses/:address/currencies/:currency | `address` - Address<br/> `currency` - Currency<br/>  |  | Reply with `True` if the address is valid, and `False` otherwise. `[4]`<br/>  |
| GET | /api/profile |  |  | Fetch the client’s current user profile - the datatype CProfile. [5]<br/>  |
| POST | /api/profile |  |  | Update the user’s profile, returning the new one in the process.<br/>  |

| GET | /api/txs/histories/:address/:search | `address` - Address, history of which should be fetched<br/> `search` - Wallet title search pattern<br/>  | `skip` - Skip this many transactions<br/> `limit` - Max numbers of transactions to return<br/>  | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions whose title has search as an infix, in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`<br/>  |
| POST | /api/txs/payments/:address/:transaction | `address` - Address, history of which should be fetched<br/> `transaction` - Transaction id<br/>  |  | Add the transaction that has the given ID to the wallet’s transaction history, if such a transaction exists.<br/>  |
| POST | /api/txs/payments/:from/:to/:amount | `from` - Address which coins should be sent from.<br/> `to` - Destination address.<br/> `amount` - Amount of coins to send.<br/>  |  | Send coins in the default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, without any transaction message or description. `[1]`<br/>  |
| POST | /api/txs/payments/:from/:to/:amount/:currency/:title/:description | `from` - Address from which coins should be sent.<br/> `to` - Destination address.<br/> `amount` - Amount of coins to send.<br/> `currency` - Currency<br/> `title` - Transaction title<br/> `description` - Transaction description<br/>  |  | Send coins with currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, with title and description.<br/>  |

| GET | /api/wallets |  |  | Fetch all wallets which the system has access to.<br/>  |
| POST | /api/wallets |  |  | Create a new wallet.<br/>  |
| DELETE | /api/wallets/:walletId | `walletId` - WalletId, walletId = address, future versions should have HD wallets, and then it should have multiple addresses<br/>  |  | Delete the wallet associated to an address.<br/>  |
| GET | /api/wallets/:walletId | `walletId` - WalletId, walletId = address, future versions should have HD wallets, and then it should have multiple addresses<br/>  |  | Fetch the wallet related to a given address address, if it exists.<br/>  |
| PUT | /api/wallets/:walletId | `walletId` - WalletId, walletId = address, future versions should have HD wallets, and then it should have multiple addresses<br/>  |  | Given an address and wallet meta-information, update the address’ wallet.<br/>  |
| POST | /api/wallets/keys |  |  | Import wallet from a key.<br/>  |
| POST | /api/wallets/restore |  |  | Recover the wallet associated to the given backup information `[3]`, if it exists.<br/>  |

Comments:

* `[1]`: Neither of these methods presently support many-to-many transactions.
* `[2]`: The transactions are in ascending order of age, i.e. newer transactions come first.
* `[3]`: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39#reminder-for-developers
* `[4]`: Presently, any currency other than `ADA` results in a `False`.
* `[5]`: `CProfile` has several fields, among them: the user's name, their email, their phone number, the hash of their password, the `POSIX`-formatted time at which the account was created, their location, and the account's picture.
* `[6]`: An `ADA` redemption token is represented by the datatype `CWalletRedeem`, which has the address where the `ADA` intended to be redeemed will go to, and a redemption seed.

### Wallet events

Aside from these HTTP endpoints there is one unidirectional websocket channel
opened from server to client. This channel serves as notification system so
that Daedalus UI can be informed about events. Currently supported events are:

* `LocalDifficultyChanged` - local blockchain height
* `NetworkDifficultyChanged` - global blockchain height
* `UpdateAvailable` - new system update available
* `ConnectedPeersChanged` - number of peers connected to the node changed
* `ConnectionOpened` - websocket connection opened
* `ConnectionClosed` - websocket connection closed

As this channel is unidirectional, any message sent to the channel from the
client will be ignored.
