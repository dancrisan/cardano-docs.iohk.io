# Blocks in Cardano SL

This guide describes blocks design and logic of the block handling.

Block-related types are defined in [Pos.Types.Block.Types](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/63adb31e813e21ec9da21cfa69984840308bbfa2/src/Pos/Types/Block/Types.hs) module. Logic is defined in [Pos.Block.Logic](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs) module.

## Design

Block is a fundamental part of the ledger. There are two kinds of blocks: **main** block and **genesis** block.

### Main Block

Main block consists of *header* and *body*. A header contains meta-information about the block,
like a block signature. A body contains 4 primary components:

1. transactions (with a separate witnesses for them),
2. SSC,
3. delegation,
4. update system.

**Transactions** are stored in the Merkle tree. The list of witnesses for each transaction is stored in the block separately.
Please read about [Transactions in Cardano SL](/cardano/transactions/) for more info about transaction and witnesses.

**SSC** (Shared Seed Computation) is used for the [Follow-the-Satoshi algorithm](/cardano/proof-of-stake/#follow-the-satoshi). 
Every epoch we must elect slot-leaders for the next epoch, these slot-leaders will be able to generate new main blocks and add them in the ledger. So we use SSC to generate a randomness for the leader election process.  

**Delegation** is a mechanism that allows a node to be a delegate of some other node. For example, if some node `D` is a delegate of the node `I`, then:

* if `I` is a leader, node `D` have a right to issue a new block;
* if `I` has some money, we can think that `D` owns these money.

Delegate can prove his rights with a special certificate. Please note that only heavyweight delegation data is stored in the block.

Special payload is using for the **update system** mechanism. It contains:

1. proposal for software update (update for the nodes and update of the protocol itself);
2. list of votes for the particular update (stakeholders can approve or reject one);
3. attributes, for an extension in the future (we can use an attributes to add some new features).

Proposal is an optional data. Please read about [Update System Model](/cardano/update-mechanism/) for more info.

### Genesis Block

Genesis block doesn't contain transactions, and we have just one genesis block for each epoch. Genesis block has a header and a body as well as main block. Block's body contains:

1. an index of the epoch this block associated with,
2. the list of slot-leaders for this epoch,
3. chain difficulty.

Please note that list of slot-leaders (actually list of leaders' `addressHash`es) cannot be empty, because every epoch must have exactly `N` slot-leaders, where `N` is a number of slots inside one epoch (and this number is obviously bigger than 0).

Chain difficulty represents necessary effort to generate a chain, actually it's a number of the main blocks in the chain.

## Block Handling Logic

We work with blocks and block headers. Fundamentally, we can:

* create a block,
* verify a block,
* apply a block,
* rollback a block,

and:

* get block headers by different criteria,
* classify block headers.

## Block Creation

As mentioned above, there are two kinds of blocks: a **main** block and a **genesis** block.
A main block is created with the
[`createMainBlock`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L29)
function and a genesis block is created with the
[`createGenesisBlock`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L28)
function.

### Main Block Creation

We try to create a new main block on top of the best chain if possible.
A new block can be created if the following conditions are met:

* We know the genesis block for the epoch from the given slot ID,
* The last known block is not more than [`slotSecurityParam`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L55) blocks away from given slot id.

The value of [`slotSecurityParam`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L103)
(which actually is a number of slots) depends on maximum number of blocks
which can be rolled back. This [maximum number](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L98)
is a security parameter from the protocol paper.

First of all, we have to check whether our software can create a block
according to current global state. If it can not, we just report that this
software is obsolete. If it can, we have to [check slot ID](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L633):
it shouldn't be too large but should be larger than the slot ID from the last
known block. Then, if this condition is met, we can [actually create the new block](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L646).

### Genesis Block Creation

We create a genesis block for the current epoch when the head of currently known
best chain is [`MainBlock`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L76)
corresponding to one of the last [`slotSecurityParam`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L103) slots of (i - 1)-th epoch.

First of all, we try to get the slot-leaders. If there's no leaders or not enough blocks
for LRC (Leaders and Richmen Computation), an error is reported, otherwise we're
trying to actually create [a new genesis block](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L581). However, sometimes we [shouldn't create one](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L558). For example, we shouldn't do it [for the 0-th epoch](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L560).

## Block Application

We apply blocks using the [`applyBlocks`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L474)
function. The sequence of blocks should be definitely valid:
we must verify all predicates and data checks regarding blocks.
**Important**: all blocks in that sequence must be of the same epoch!

If everything is ok, we [actually apply blocks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic/Internal.hs#L77):

* [apply US (Update System)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Update/Logic/Global.hs#L60),
* [apply delegation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Delegation/Logic.hs#L290),
* [apply transactions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Txp/Logic.hs#L72).

Moreover, we can verify blocks before application (i.e. apply blocks only if
they're valid). We use [`verifyAndApplyBlocks`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L404)
function for it. If some error occurred during application, there are two options:

1. All blocks applied inside this function will be rollbacked.
2. This function will try to apply as much blocks as it's possible.

## Block Rollback

You can think about a rollback as the opposite of application: when a rollback is
performed, all changes made by the application are cancelled. To do this, the
[`rollbackBlocks`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L491)
function is used.

We get the tip and the first block to rollback. If they do not match,
an error is reported. If they match, we
[actually rollback the sequence of blocks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic/Internal.hs#L107):

* [Rollback delegation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Delegation/Logic.hs#L327), erases mempool of certificates,
* [Rollback US](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Update/Logic/Global.hs#L86),
* [Rollback transactions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Txp/Logic.hs#L224).

Of course, sometimes we cannot rollback blocks. For example, it's [impossible to rollback 0-th genesis block](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic/Internal.hs#L118).

## Block Headers Classification

A header can be classified as:

1. [Valid](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L196),
2. [Invalid](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L198),
3. [Useless](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L197).

The function [`classifyHeaders`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L207)
is used for it.

A header is treated as **useless** if the following conditions are met:

* [The newest hash is the same as our tip](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L219),
* [The newest hash difficulty is not greater than our tip's](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L221),
* [LCA couldn't be found, maybe db state was updated during the process](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L223),
* [The difference between the tip and LCA is too big](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L241).

A header is treated as **invalid** if there are
[any errors in the chain of headers](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L215)
or if [the last block of the passed chain wasn't found locally](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/517a72801c0bbb11a34c8d6a6d528fff5f094471/src/Pos/Block/Logic.hs#L217).
