# Reward Era

Ninety days after the release, the reward era will start. This is part
of Cardano SL lifetime during which the network will operate in a
completely decentralized, trustless mode. We expect staking pools to
emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get
rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to
maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.

The system will receive regular software updates moving forward and
massive amount of new features will be released later in 2017.
