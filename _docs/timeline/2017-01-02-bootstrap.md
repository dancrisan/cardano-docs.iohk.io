# Bootstrap Era

After the Cardano SL Testnet era and release of Cardano SL, the network will operate
in “bootstrap mode” for a period of time called Bootstrap era.
As people who purchased Ada redeem their coins, the stake will automatically get delegated to a pool of
trusted nodes that will maintain the network. During this time no block rewards will be issued —
we will maintain the network pro bono. This is required because in order for the protocol to
function properly, some of the stakeholders who jointly posses majority of stake have to be online,
which in reality won't be the case during the first months of network operation.

The Bootstrap era will lead to the [Reward era](/timeline/reward), during which updates to the protocol
will be issued, and the major stakeholders will be provided with
convenient options to run their nodes on personal servers in the cloud.
