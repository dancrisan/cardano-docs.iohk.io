# Testnet Era

In January 2017, a Cardano SL test network was launched. The testnet is
required to get the community acquainted with the cryptocurrency and to
polish the implementation, eliminating possible flaws or instabilities.

During the Testnet era all functionality, including the reward mechanism,
will be activated. Anyone will be able to redeem a private key from Cardano
SL Testnet Faucet to get their coin supply.

In late March 2017, the testnet will be reset and users will be
asked to download a new, updated version of Cardano SL. This part of the
Testnet era can be thought of as beta testing, resulting in the
[release](/timeline/bootstrap) of Cardano SL in March.

We encourage everyone to download Cardano SL client for your platform,
get some coins (we call them [Lovelace](/glossary/#lovelace)) from the
faucet and invite other people to participate in beta testing.
