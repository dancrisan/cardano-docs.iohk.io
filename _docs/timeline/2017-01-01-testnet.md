# Testnet Era

The Cardano SL test network (testnet) is required to get the community
acquainted with the cryptocurrency and to polish the implementation,
eliminating possible flaws or instabilities.

During the Testnet era all functionality, including the reward mechanism,
will be activated. Anyone will be able to redeem a private key from Cardano
SL Testnet Faucet to get their coin supply.

We encourage everyone to download Cardano SL client for your platform,
get some coins (we call them [Lovelace](/glossary/#lovelace)) from the
faucet and invite other people to participate in beta testing.

The final of the testnet era is the [release](/timeline/bootstrap) of Cardano SL.
