# What is Daedalus

In developing Cardano SL, the need arose for a UI from which users could access
their funds, send and receive transactions, and perform other tasks related to
managing a personal cryptocurrency wallet. The Daedalus wallet is the Cardano's
solution to these necessities.

Currently, it allows a user to use their ADA in the aforementioned actions, and
support for other currencies is planned for the near future, as is the exchange
between different currencies, both digital and not.

## Building `daedalus-client-api`

To run `daedalus-client-api` locally you have to start the `wallet-api` of [`cardano-sl`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/) as follows. Make sure that your are on the root folder of `cardano-sl`.

```bash
# build app
stack build
# remove old PureScript types if they exist
rm -rf daedalus/src/Generated
# generate PureScript types
stack exec -- cardano-wallet-hs2purs
```

This should create PureScript modules with datatypes bridged from Haskell. You should have similar structure like:

```bash
$ tree daedalus/src/Generated/
daedalus/src/Generated/
└── Pos
    ├── Types
    │   └── Core.purs
    ├── Util
    │   └── BackupPhrase.purs
    └── Wallet
        └── Web
            ├── ClientTypes.purs
            └── Error.purs
```

## Running and testing `daedalus-client-api`

In order to see `daedalus-client-api` in action first run local cardano network:

```bash
# run tmux in another window
tmux
# launch nodes
export WALLET_TEST=1; ./scripts/launch.sh
```

By default this should launch cardano network consisting of 3 nodeds talking to each other. `WALLET_TEST=1` tells the launcher script to run `wallet-api` with one node. This one node running `wallet-api` will behave the same as Daedalus wallet that is run in production. If you run into some issues remove the following content first and build `wallet-api` again as described above.

```
rm -rf ./run/*
rm -rf wallet-db
rm node-*.*.key
```

With a running `wallet-api` you can run `daedalus-client-api` locally as follows.
Please note that [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is required to build `daedalus-client-api`.

```bash
cd daedalus
yarn install
yarn build:prod
```

Now we can try using the client api with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/):

```bash
$ node
> var api = require('../output/Daedalus.ClientApi')
undefined
> api
{ applyUpdate: [Function],
  blockchainSlotDuration: [Function],
  deleteWallet: [Function],
  generateMnemonic: [Function: generateMnemonic],
  getHistory: [Function],
  getProfile: [Function],
  getWallet: [Function],
  getWallets: [Function],
  isValidAddress: [Function],
  newWallet: [Function],
  nextUpdate: [Function],
  notify: [Function],
  postponeUpdatesUntil: [Function],
  redeemADA: [Function],
  restoreWallet: [Function],
  restoreWalletIgnoreChecksum: [Function],
  searchHistory: [Function],
  send: [Function],
  sendExtended: [Function],
  systemVersion: [Function],
  updateProfile: [Function],
  updateTransaction: [Function],
  updateWallet: [Function] }
```

This will load and show all functions that can be run from from this library to interact with the wallet. For example, to fetch all available wallets we can do:

```bash
> api.getWallets().then(console.log).catch(console.log)
Promise { <pending> }
> [ { cwMeta:
     { cwType: 'CWTPersonal',
       cwName: 'Personal Wallet',
       cwCurrency: 'ADA' },
    cwAmount: { getCoin: 33333 },
    cwAddress: '1gLFDJAKutVJCYioMANx4gthHru5K12Tk9YpEmXKQfggKZu' } ]
```

Note: `daedalus-client-api` is not optimized / compressed. This is will be a job for Daedalus.


## Wallet Frontend API

Currently, the wallet's API provides a series of methods to work
with wallets. The `servant` Haskell library that provides a modular
approach to API-building was used. This library uses combinators to both build atomic HTTP actions and to glue these atomic methods together to form larger and more
complete APIs.

If the event requests fail, there is a `WalletError` type, which
is simply a wrapper over `Text` to show what happened.

Please note that:

* The code `Post '[JSON]` and `Get '[JSON]` indicates that the type of the contents in the message will be `[JSON]`.
* `ReqBody '[JSON] t` extracts the request body `[JSON]` as a value of type `t`.

Currently, the wallet's API supports the following operations (see Comments below):

|---
| API endpoint | Uses | Action | Description
|:-|:-|:-|:-
| `get_wallet` | `address :: CAddress` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Fetch the wallet related to a given address address, if it exists.
| `get-wallets` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError [CWallet])` | Fetch all wallets to which the system has access to.
| `send` | `from, to :: CAddress;`<br/> `amount :: Coin` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CTx)` | Send coins in the default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, without any transaction message or description. `[1]`
| `txhistory` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/> `limit :: Word` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions where the address took part in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `search-txhistory` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `search :: Text;`<br/> `skip :: Word;`<br/> `limit :: Word` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError ([CTx], Word))` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions whose title has `search` as an infix, in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `update-transaction` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `transaction :: CTxId;`<br/> `ReqBody '[JSON] CTxMeta` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Add the transaction which has the given ID to the wallet's transaction history, if such a transaction exists.
| `new-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Create a new wallet.
| `restore-wallet` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletInit` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Recover the wallet associated to the given backup information `[3]`, if it exists.
| `update-wallet` | `address :: CAddress;`<br/> `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletMeta` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Given an address and wallet meta-information, update the address' wallet.
| `delete_wallet` | `address :: CAddress` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Delete the wallet associated to an address.
| `valid-address` | `currency :: CCurrency;`<br/> `address :: Text` | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Bool)` | Reply with `True` if the address is valid, and `False` otherwise. `[4]`
| `get-profile` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` | Fetch the client's current user profile - the datatype `CProfile`. `[5]`
| `update-profile` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CProfile` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CProfile)` | Update the user's profile, returning the new one in the process.
| `redeem-ada` | `ReqBody '[JSON] CWalletRedeem` | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError CWallet)` | Redeem ADA from a token `[6]`, create and return a wallet with the redeemded ADA.
| `next-update` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError CUpdateInfo)` | Fetch information related to the next update.
| `apply-update` | Nothing | `Post '[JSON] (Either WalletError ())` | Apply the system's most recent update.
| `slot-duration` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError Word)` | Fetch the value of current slot duration.
| `system-version` | Nothing | `Get '[JSON] (Either WalletError SoftwareVersion)` | Fetch the system's version.

Except these HTTP endpoints there is one unidirectional websocket channel opened from server to client. This channel serves as notification system so that Daedalus UI can be informed about events. Currently supported events are:

* `LocalDifficultyChanged` - local blockchain height
* `NetworkDifficultyChanged` - global blockchain height
* `UpdateAvailable` - new system update available
* `ConnectionOpened` - websocket connection opened
* `ConnectionClosed` - websocket connection closed

As it is unidirectional channel, any message sent to the channel from the client will be ignored.

Comments:

* `[1]`: Neither of these methods presently support many-to-many transactions.
* `[2]`: The transactions are in ascending order of age, i.e. newer transactions come first.
* `[3]`: A wallet's backup phrase and a wallet's meta-information (`CWalletMeta`).
* `[4]`: Presently, any currency other than `ADA` results in a `False`.
* `[5]`: `CProfile` has several fields, among them: the user's name, their email, their phone number, the hash of their password, the `POSIX`-formatted time at which the account was created, their location, and the account's picture.
* `[6]`: An `ADA` redemption token is represented by the datatype `CWalletRedeem`, which has the address where the `ADA` intended to be redeemed will go to, and a redemption seed.
