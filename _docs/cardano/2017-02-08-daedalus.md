# What is Daedalus

In developing Cardano SL, the need arose for a UI from which users could access
their funds, send and receive transactions, and perform other tasks related to
managing a personal cryptocurrency wallet. The Daedalus wallet is the Cardano's
solution to these necessities.

Currently, it allows a user to use their ADA in the aforementioned actions, and
support for other currencies is planned for the near future, as is the exchange
between different currencies, both digital and not.

## Building `daedalus-client-api`

To run `daedalus-client-api` locally you have to start the `wallet-api` of [`cardano-sl`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/) as follows. Make sure that your are on the root folder of `cardano-sl`.

```bash
# build app
stack build
# remove old PureScript types if they exist
rm -rf daedalus/src/Generated
# generate PureScript types
stack exec -- cardano-wallet-hs2purs
```

This should create PureScript modules with datatypes bridged from Haskell. You should have similar structure like:

```bash
$ tree daedalus/src/Generated/
daedalus/src/Generated/
└── Pos
	├── Types
	│   └── Core.purs
	├── Util
	│   └── BackupPhrase.purs
	└── Wallet
		└── Web
			├── ClientTypes.purs
			└── Error.purs
```

## Running and testing `daedalus-client-api`

In order to see `daedalus-client-api` in action first run local cardano network:

```bash
# run tmux in another window
tmux
# launch nodes
export WALLET_TEST=1; ./scripts/launch.sh
```

By default this should launch cardano network consisting of 3 nodeds talking to each other. `WALLET_TEST=1` tells the launcher script to run `wallet-api` with one node. This one node running `wallet-api` will behave the same as Daedalus wallet that is run in production. If you run into some issues remove the following content first and build `wallet-api` again as described above.

```
rm -rf ./run/*
rm -rf wallet-db
rm node-*.*.key
```

With a running `wallet-api` you can run `daedalus-client-api` locally as follows.
Please note that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required to build `daedalus-client-api`.

```bash
cd daedalus
npm install
npm run build:prod
```

Now we can try using the client api with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/):

```bash
$ node
> var api = require('../output/Daedalus.ClientApi')
undefined
> api
{ applyUpdate: [Function],
  blockchainSlotDuration: [Function],
  deleteWallet: [Function],
  generateMnemonic: [Function: generateMnemonic],
  getHistory: [Function],
  getProfile: [Function],
  getWallet: [Function],
  getWallets: [Function],
  importKey: [Function],
  isValidAddress: [Function],
  isValidMnemonic: [Function],
  newWallet: [Function],
  nextUpdate: [Function],
  notify: [Function],
  redeemADA: [Function],
  restoreWallet: [Function],
  restoreWalletIgnoreChecksum: [Function],
  searchHistory: [Function],
  send: [Function],
  sendExtended: [Function],
  systemVersion: [Function],
  updateProfile: [Function],
  updateTransaction: [Function],
  updateWallet: [Function] }
```

This will load and show all functions that can be run from from this library to interact with the wallet. For example, to fetch all available wallets we can do:

```bash
> api.getWallets().then(console.log).catch(console.log)
Promise { <pending> }
> [ { cwMeta:
	 { cwType: 'CWTPersonal',
	   cwName: 'Personal Wallet',
	   cwCurrency: 'ADA' },
	cwAmount: { getCoin: 33333 },
	cwAddress: '1gLFDJAKutVJCYioMANx4gthHru5K12Tk9YpEmXKQfggKZu' } ]
```

Note: `daedalus-client-api` is not optimized / compressed. This is will be a job for Daedalus.


## Wallet Frontend API

Currently, the wallet's API provides a series of methods to work
with wallets. The `servant` Haskell library that provides a modular
approach to API-building was used. This library uses combinators to both build atomic HTTP actions and to glue these atomic methods together to form larger and more
complete APIs.

If the event requests fail, there is a `WalletError` type, which
is simply a wrapper over `Text` to show what happened.

Please note that:

* `Promise t` is, in this table, pseudocode that says the value of type `t`
inside the `Promise` datatype is being represented as `JSON`.

Currently, the client's API supports the following operations (see Comments below):

|---
| API endpoint | Uses | Action | Description
|:-|:-|:-|:-
| `getWallet` | `address :: String` | `Promise CWallet` | Fetch the wallet related to a given address address, if it exists.
| `getWallets` | Nothing | `Promise (Array CWallet)` | Fetch all wallets to which the system has access to.
| `send` | `from, to :: String;`<br/> `amount :: Int` | `Promise CTx` | Send coins in the default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, without any transaction message or description. `[1]`
| `sendExtended` | `from, to :: String;`<br/> `amount :: Int;`<br/> `title :: String;`<br/> `description :: String;` | `Promise CTx` | Send coins in the default currency (presently, `ADA`) from an origin address to a destination address, with transaction message or description. `[1]`
| `getHistory` | `address :: String;`<br/> `skip :: Int;`<br/> `limit :: Int` | `Promise (Tuple (Array CTx) Int)` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions where the address took part in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `searchHistory` | `address :: String;`<br/> `search :: String;`<br/> `skip :: Int;`<br/> `limit :: Int` | `Promise (Tuple (Array CTx) Int)` | Fetch a tuple with the list of transactions whose title has `search` as an infix, in the index interval [skip + 1, limit], and its length. `[2]`
| `updateTransaction` | `address :: String;`<br/> `transactionId :: String;`<br/> `currency :: String;`<br/> `title :: String;`<br/> `description :: String;`<br/> `date :: Number;` | `Promise Unit` | Update metadata of transaction which has the given ID. The data is only visible locally to the user and its not sent over the network.
| `generateMnemonic` | Nothing | `String` | Generate a BIP39 mnemonic for the wallet. [4]
| `isValidMnemonic` | `mnemonic :: String` | `Boolean` | Verify that the given mnemonic is both valid as per BIP39 rules and contains at least 12 words.

Comments:

* `[1]`: Neither of these methods presently support many-to-many transactions.
* `[2]`: The transactions are in ascending order of age, i.e. newer transactions come first.
* `[3] : https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39#reminder-for-developers
* `[4]`: Presently, any currency other than `ADA` results in a `False`.
* `[5]`: `CProfile` has several fields, among them: the user's name, their email, their phone number, the hash of their password, the `POSIX`-formatted time at which the account was created, their location, and the account's picture.
* `[6]`: An `ADA` redemption token is represented by the datatype `CWalletRedeem`, which has the address where the `ADA` intended to be redeemed will go to, and a redemption seed.

### Wallet events

Aside from these HTTP endpoints there is one unidirectional websocket channel
opened from server to client. This channel serves as notification system so
that Daedalus UI can be informed about events. Currently supported events are:

* `LocalDifficultyChanged` - local blockchain height
* `NetworkDifficultyChanged` - global blockchain height
* `UpdateAvailable` - new system update available
* `ConnectedPeersChanged` - number of peers connected to the node changed
* `ConnectionOpened` - websocket connection opened
* `ConnectionClosed` - websocket connection closed

As it is unidirectional channel, any message sent to the channel from the
client will be ignored.
